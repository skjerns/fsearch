## Build Instructions

<https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch/wiki/Build-instructions>

## Localization

The localization of FSearch is managed with Weblate.

<https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fsearch/>

If you want to contribute translations please submit them there, instead of opening pull requests on GitHub. This also includes any suggestions to the English texts â€” English isn't my first language, so there are likely errors and unusual wordings.

Instructions can be found here:
<https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/basic.html>

And of course: Thank you for taking the time to translate FSearch!

## Current Limitations

* Sorting lots of results by *Type* can be very slow, since gathering that information is expensive, and the data isn't
  indexed. This also means that when the view is sorted by *Type*, searching will reset the sort order to *Name*.
* Using the *Move to Trash* option doesn't update the database index, so trashed files/folders show up in the result
  list as if nothing happened to them.

## Why yet another search utility?

Performance. On Windows I really like to use Everything Search Engine. It provides instant results as you type for all
your files and lots of useful features (regex, filters, bookmarks, ...). On Linux I couldn't find anything that's even
remotely as fast and powerful.

Before I started working on FSearch, I took a look at existing solutions. I tried MATE Search Tool (formerly GNOME
Search Tool), Recoll, Krusader (locate based search), SpaceFM File Search, Nautilus, ANGRYsearch and Catfish, to find
out whether it makes sense to improve those. However, they're not exactly what I was looking for:

- standalone application (not part of a file manager)
- written in a language with C like performance
- no dependencies to any specific desktop environment
- Qt5 or GTK3 based
- small memory usage (both hard drive and RAM)
- target audience: advanced users

## Looking for a command line interface?

I highly recommend [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or the obvious tools: find and (m)locate

## Why GTK3 and not Qt5?

I like both of them, and my long term goal is to provide console, GTK3 and Qt5 interfaces, or at least make it easy for
others to build those. However, for the time being it's only GTK3 because I like C more than C++, and I'm more familiar
with GTK development.
